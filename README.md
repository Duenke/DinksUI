# Dinks' Immersive UI

**Disclaimer: This addon is primarily built for personal use and learning. The software comes as is.**

## Description

Dinks' Immersive UI is a World of Warcraft addon designed to enhance your gameplay experience by clearing up the UI until you need to see the UI elements. It allows you to customize which frames are shown or hidden based on your preferences. You can use regular macro conditionals to control the visibility of each frame.

## Features

- Simplifies the UI by hiding unnecessary elements
- Customizable settings for each frame
- Supports regular macro conditionals for conditional visibility
- Default settings based on personal usage

## Installation

1. Download the latest version from [CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/dinksui).
2. Extract the downloaded file into your World of Warcraft `_retail_/Interface/AddOns` directory.
3. Reload World of Warcraft to load the addon. (You no longer need to restart the WoW game client.)

## Usage

1. Open the settings by typing `/dinksui` or `/dui` in the chat.
2. Customize the visibility of each frame using regular macro conditionals.
3. Save your settings and enjoy a clutter-free UI until you need it.
4. Temporarily toggle on all frames by typing `/dinksui show`. Type `/dinksui hide` to hide the frames again. Type `/dinksui help` or `/dui h` for help.
