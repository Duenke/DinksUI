This addon uses [AceAddon 3](https://www.wowace.com/projects/ace3/pages/getting-started) libraries to simplify all the boilerplate of initial frame creation and hooking events.

Only the required libraries have been retained, but AceAddon does offer more.

If you encounter some issue about missing methods in your hacking, make sure you have all the required libraries.

That said, all my code, and all further work is done inside [DinksUI.lua](./DinksUI.lua).  
Additionally, updates to this addon will require bumping the version number in [DinksUI.toc](./DinksUI.toc).

If you find a feature missing or a bug fix, please feel encouraged to submit a pull request for review!

Also feel free to fork this project for your own personal use and learning!
